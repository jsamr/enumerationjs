## Basic usage with raw descriptors
> ✓ If an enum type called 'closeEventCodes' already exists, an error will show up  
> ✓ If a duplicate id is given, an error will show up  
> ✓ If a key conflicts with one amongst enum type reserved methods, an error will show up : you should always use uppercase strings as keys to avoid any conflict - plus it's a standard for enums.
